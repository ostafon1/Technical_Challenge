# Part 2: Container Security Implementation

## Docker Security Best Practices

### Best Practices
1. **Use Official Images**: Always use official and verified images from trusted sources to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities.
2. **Run Containers as Non-Root Users**: Avoid running containers as the root user to reduce the impact of a potential container compromise.
3. **Regularly Scan Images for Vulnerabilities**: Use tools like SonarQube to scan images for known vulnerabilities.
4. **Use Minimal Base Images**: Choose minimal base images like `alpine` to reduce the attack surface.
5. **Implement Resource Limits**: Set CPU and memory limits to prevent resource exhaustion attacks

### Dockerfile Example
The Dockerfile implementing one of the best practices (running containers as non-root users) is included in this directory.

## Kubernetes Security Configuration

### Security Features
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: RBAC restricts access to the Kubernetes API based on the roles assigned to users and applications. This ensures that only authorized entities can perform specific actions.
2. **Network Policies**: Network policies define how pods communicate with each other and with other network endpoints. They help enforce isolation and limit the blast radius of a compromised pod.
3. **Pod Security Policies (PSP)**: PSPs control the security settings applied to pods, such as restricting the use of privileged containers, enforcing read-only root file systems, and setting user IDs.

### Kubernetes yaml configuration that includes securityContext settings for a pod.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secure-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: secure-container
    image: nginx
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 1000
      runAsGroup: 3000
      fsGroup: 2000
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false


## IaaS Security Measures
### Concept
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It allows organizations to rent virtual machines, storage, and networking infrastructure on a pay-as-you-go basis. While IaaS offers flexibility and scalability, it also introduces security challenges that need to be addressed.

### Security Implications
1. **Strong Authentication and Access Controls**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can access and manage IaaS resources.
2. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt data both at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access. Use encryption services provided by the cloud provider, such as AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
3. **Regular Updates and Patching**: Keep the operating systems, applications, and infrastructure components up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities.
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Enable comprehensive monitoring and logging to detect and respond to security incidents. Use services like AWS CloudTrail and AWS CloudWatch for logging and monitoring activities.
5. **Network Security**: Implement network security measures such as virtual private clouds (VPCs), security groups, and network access control lists (ACLs) to control and restrict network traffic.
