# Part 2: Container Security Implementation

## Docker Security Best Practices

### Best Practices
1. **Use Official Images**: Always use official and verified images from trusted sources to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities.
2. **Run Containers as Non-Root Users**: Avoid running containers as the root user to reduce the impact of a potential container compromise.
3. **Regularly Scan Images for Vulnerabilities**: Use tools like SonarQube to scan images for known vulnerabilities.
4. **Use Minimal Base Images**: Choose minimal base images like `alpine` to reduce the attack surface.
5. **Implement Resource Limits**: Set CPU and memory limits to prevent resource exhaustion attacks
