# Part 1: Cybersecurity Scenario

## Threat Intelligence Report

### Types of common attacks
1. **SQL Injection**: Attackers insert malicious SQL code into a query, allowing them to manipulate the database.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
3. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Attackers execute arbitrary code on a remote system.
4. **Phishing**: Attackers trick users into providing sensitive information through deceptive emails or websites.
5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Attackers overwhelm a system with traffic, rendering it unavailable.

### Vulnerability exploitation
An unpatched vulnerability in a web application can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access. For example, an SQL injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or even administrative control over the database. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete system compromise.

### Preventive Measures
1. **Regular Updates and Patching**: Ensure all software and systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
2. **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**: Deploy WAFs to filter and monitor HTTP traffic to and from web applications.
3. **Security Audits and Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
4. **Input Validation**: Implement strong input validation to prevent injection attacks.
5. **User Education and Awareness**: Train employees on security best practices and how to recognize phishing attempts.

## Incident Response Plan

### Containment
1. **Isolate Affected Systems**: Disconnect compromised systems from the network to prevent further spread.
2. **Disable Compromised Accounts**: Temporarily disable accounts that may have been compromised.
3. **Activate Incident Response Team**: Assemble the incident response team to manage the situation.

### Eradication
1. **Identify Root Cause**: Determine the root cause of the breach and eliminate it.
2. **Remove Malicious Code**: Scan and remove any malicious code or backdoors installed by attackers.
3. **Apply Patches**: Patch the exploited vulnerability to prevent future attacks.

### Recovery
1. **Restore Systems**: Restore affected systems from clean backups.
2. **Monitor Systems**: Implement enhanced monitoring to detect any signs of further compromise.
3. **Communicate with Stakeholders**: Inform stakeholders about the breach and the steps taken to address it.

## Network Security Measures

### Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
- **Function**: Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and take action to block or alert on potential threats.
- **Implementation**: Deploy IDS/IPS solutions like Snort or Suricata to monitor network traffic.

### Firewalls
- **Function**: Control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- **Implementation**: Use firewalls to create a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks, such as pfSense or AWS Security Groups.

### Network Segmentation
- **Function**: Divide the network into smaller, isolated segments to limit the spread of an attack.
- **Implementation**: Use VLANs and subnets to segment the network and apply access controls to each segment.

### Additional Measures
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Implement MFA to add an extra layer of security for user authentication.
2. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access.
3. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Use SIEM solutions to collect, analyze, and correlate security events from various sources.
